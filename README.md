# Maritime Cyber #
This a side-project conducted as part of research into cyber-activity between China and maritime neighbours (with whom China has some dispute).

It combines two different databases of international cyber incidents with a webscraped timeline of maritime tension news from the Financial Times.

This is useful for attempting to correlate Chinese cyber-activity with geopolitical context in the South China and East China seas.
